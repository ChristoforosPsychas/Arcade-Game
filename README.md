### Instructions

Use the arrow keys to move the player around. You must avoid the bugs or otherwise you will be returned to the starting position. Your goal is to reach the water.

To get started, open the `index.html` file in your browser after downloading or cloning the files, or press the live page below and start playing!

### How The Game Works

Welcome to my Immortal Arcade Game!
The game board consists of five(5) enemies (bugs) and a player arranged in a canvas made with some given images. When the game starts, the player can see all the bugs moving at a random speed across the paved block portion of the scene only. The player can stay safely across the grass block portion of the scene. In addition, as you can see from the name of my game, there are no lives in this game. The player has unlimited tries to succeed and reach the water. Every time the player reaches the water, his score increases by 1. When he scores 5 times, the game ends with a winning message appearing to the player.

### Development

This Memory Game Project is made by Christoforos Psychas for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.
